KREPLA - Kivy REPL for Android
==============================

A Python REPL for Android created using Kivy.

A couple of other Python REPLs for Android already exist, but they try very
hard to act like the standard Python REPL. touch actions are just work-arounds
for annoying desktop assumptions. This REPL aims to be better designed for
mobile devices, specifically Android tablets and phones.
